Here we are going to Prepare a chat bot Using Natural Language Processing and Tensorflow.

In this Jupyter Notebook, We are going to Build a Chatbot that has the ability to understand and analyse the Context of the given Sentenses and Responds accordingly. 
#  Agenda 
Main agenda of this project is to deal with these three bullet points.
➥ Transforming the Conversational Intents into Tensorflow model (Neural Network using TFLEARN) using NLP (Natural Language Processing)and Save it as Pickle also.
 ➥Load the Same Pickle and Model to Build the Framework to Process the Responses.
  ➥At Last, We will be displaying How the Inputs are Processed to Give the Reponses.
