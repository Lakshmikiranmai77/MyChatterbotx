Here we are going to Prepare a chat bot Using Natural Language Processing and Tensorflow.
In this Jupyter Notebook, We are going to Build a Chatbot that has the ability to understand and analyse the Context of the given Sentenses and Responds accordingly. 
#  Agenda 
Main agenda of this project is to deal with these three bullet points.
1) Transforming the Conversational Intents into Tensorflow model (Neural Network using TFLEARN) using NLP (Natural Language Processing)and Save it as Pickle also.
2) Load the Same Pickle and Model to Build the Framework to Process the Responses.
3) At Last, We will be displaying How the Inputs are Processed to Give the Reponses.

# Things To Know Beforehead

 # TFLEARN  
     TFlearn is a modular and transparent deep learning library built on top of Tensorflow.
     It was designed to provide a higher-level API to TensorFlow in order to facilitate and speed-up experimentations, while remaining fully transparent and compatible with it. 
     You Can check it at (http://tflearn.org/)
     
# TENSORFLOW 
    TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. 
    It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
